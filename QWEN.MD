# NCA Toolkit PHP Client - Project Status

## Current Project Status
The NCA Toolkit PHP Client is fully functional with a web interface that allows users to access all available API endpoints. The client has been containerized using Docker for easy deployment and testing.

## Key Features Implemented

### Web Interface
- Clean, responsive HTML interface with modern CSS styling
- Dynamic form handling with JavaScript
- Drag and drop functionality for file uploads
- Endpoint selection with categorized options
- Result display areas with formatted responses
- Loading indicators for API requests
- Error handling with informative messages

### API Endpoint Coverage
All NCA Toolkit endpoints are implemented:
- **Audio**: Concatenate audio files
- **Image**: Convert images to video, take webpage screenshots
- **Media**: Convert media to MP3, download media, transcribe audio/video
- **YouTube**: Direct YouTube video download and info retrieval
- **Video**: Add captions, concatenate videos, extract thumbnails, cut/split/trim videos

### Technical Implementation
- PHP backend with cURL for HTTP requests
- Docker containerization for easy deployment
- Google Cloud Storage integration for file uploads
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Server-side API key storage for security

## Recent Improvements

### Drag and Drop Functionality
- Fixed issues with multiple file drag and drop
- Increased PHP upload limits to handle larger files
- Added debugging to identify upload errors
- Improved file handling for concatenate operations

### File Organization
- Moved all test files to dedicated `test_files` directory
- Created test runner scripts for easier execution
- Maintained all functionality while improving organization

### Testing
- Implemented comprehensive Playwright end-to-end tests
- Added debugging output for file upload processes
- Verified drag and drop functionality across all browsers

## Docker Deployment
The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment:

```bash
# Quick start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Access at http://localhost:8081
```

## Environment Variables
- `NCA_API_BASE_URL`: Base URL for the NCA Toolkit API
- `NCA_API_KEY`: Your API key for the NCA Toolkit (required)
- `NCA_API_TIMEOUT`: API timeout in seconds (default: 30)
- `GCS_BUCKET_NAME`: Google Cloud Storage bucket name (default: maksimum-nca)

## Security Considerations
- API key is stored server-side, never exposed to client
- Input validation for all user-submitted data
- File upload validation with size and type checking
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Testing
The project includes both automated tests and manual test scripts:

```bash
# Run Playwright end-to-end tests
npm test

# Run individual PHP test files
cd test_files
php test_api.php
```
