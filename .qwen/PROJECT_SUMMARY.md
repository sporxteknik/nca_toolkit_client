# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Fix the curl timeout error occurring with the Add Caption endpoint in the NCA Toolkit PHP Client, allowing video captioning operations to complete successfully without timing out.

## Key Knowledge
- The NCA Toolkit PHP Client is a web interface that allows users to access various API endpoints for audio, image, media, YouTube, and video processing
- The Add Caption endpoint was experiencing timeout errors after 60 seconds (60000 milliseconds) even though it was processing correctly in the backend
- Default timeout values were inconsistent across configuration files (30s, 300s, 60s)
- The application is containerized with Docker and uses environment variables for configuration
- The project follows a modular architecture with separate endpoint handlers in the `api/endpoints/` directory
- The `Video.php` file contains the `addCaption` function that needed the timeout adjustment

## Recent Actions
- Increased the timeout in the `addCaption` function in `api/endpoints/Video.php` from 60 seconds to 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- Updated default timeout values in `config.php` from 300 to 600 seconds
- Updated default timeout values in `config_with_key.php` from 30 to 600 seconds
- Added `CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT` option in `api/NcaApiClient.php` for better connection timeout handling
- Updated documentation files (`README.md`, `QWEN.MD`, `.env.example`) to reflect the new recommended timeout value of 600 seconds
- Made the `index_container.php` implementation consistent with `index.php` for handling video caption operations

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Identify the source of the timeout error (in the `addCaption` function)
- [DONE] Increase timeout from 60 seconds to 600 seconds (10 minutes) in the `addCaption` function
- [DONE] Update all configuration files to have consistent timeout values
- [DONE] Add connection timeout option to cURL requests
- [DONE] Update documentation and example files
- [DONE] Ensure consistency between `index.php` and `index_container.php` implementations
- [TODO] Test the changes in a development environment to confirm the timeout error is resolved
- [TODO] Deploy updated version to production environment
