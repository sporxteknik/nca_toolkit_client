# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a PHP client for the NCA Toolkit API with a web interface that allows users to access all available endpoints through drag-and-drop file uploads and form submissions, containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: PHP 8.1 backend with Apache, HTML/CSS frontend, JavaScript for UI interactions, Docker for containerization
- **API Integration**: NCA Toolkit API endpoints covering Audio, Image, Media, YouTube, and Video functionality
- **Architecture**: Main `index.php` interface with modular API client classes in `api/` directory, endpoint-specific handlers in `api/endpoints/`
- **Security**: API keys stored server-side as environment variables, sensitive files excluded via `.gitignore`, no hardcoded credentials in committed code
- **File Handling**: Drag-and-drop functionality with DataTransfer API, Google Cloud Storage integration for file uploads, increased PHP upload limits (100MB)
- **Testing**: Playwright end-to-end tests, organized test files in `test_files/` directory, comprehensive test coverage across all browsers
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose configuration with environment variable support, `.env.example` template for user configuration

## Recent Actions
- **Fixed Critical Bugs**: Resolved drag-and-drop functionality for multiple file uploads, corrected PHP syntax errors, fixed file upload processing logic
- **Enhanced File Handling**: Implemented proper multiple file upload support, increased PHP upload limits to handle larger files, fixed GCS upload issues
- **Code Organization**: Moved 41+ test files to dedicated `test_files/` directory, created test runner scripts, improved project structure
- **Security Hardening**: Removed hardcoded API keys from configuration files, implemented environment variable-based configuration, updated `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files
- **Documentation Updates**: Created comprehensive README with secure deployment instructions, updated QWEN.MD with project status, added `.env.example` template
- **Infrastructure Improvements**: Added `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` files, configured proper Docker build exclusions, validated Docker Compose functionality
