# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create and fix a PHP client for the NCA Toolkit API with a web interface that allows users to access all available endpoints through drag-and-drop file uploads and form submissions.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: PHP 8.1 with Apache (Docker container), JavaScript for frontend, Google Cloud Storage for file uploads
- **Architecture**: Single-page application with dynamic form loading based on endpoint selection
- **Core Components**: 
  - `index.php` - Main interface handling all endpoint requests
  - JavaScript drag-and-drop implementation with DataTransfer API
  - GCS uploader for handling file storage
  - API client for communicating with NCA Toolkit endpoints
- **Key Endpoints**: Video concatenate, audio concatenate, media transcribe, image conversion, YouTube download
- **User Requirements**: Drag-and-drop file uploads must work for multiple files, proper error handling, clean UI
- **Testing**: Playwright for frontend testing, individual PHP test files for backend functionality

## Recent Actions
- **Fixed Critical Parse Errors**: Resolved multiple PHP syntax errors in `index.php` including unmatched braces and malformed conditional structures
- **Implemented Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Fixed JavaScript file handling to properly process multiple dragged files using DataTransfer API
- **Resolved File Upload Issues**: Identified and fixed PHP upload size limitations (increased from default to 100MB) that were preventing second files from uploading
- **Organized Test Files**: Moved 41+ test files into dedicated `test_files` directory for better project organization
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout file upload and processing pipeline to identify issues
- **Verified Multi-File Processing**: Confirmed that video concatenate endpoint now properly handles and processes multiple dragged files

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Fix PHP syntax errors in main application file
2. [DONE] Implement proper drag-and-drop JavaScript handling for multiple files
3. [DONE] Resolve backend file upload size limitations
4. [DONE] Verify multi-file processing works correctly for video concatenate endpoint
5. [DONE] Organize test files into dedicated directory
6. [TODO] Implement comprehensive error handling for different file upload scenarios
7. [TODO] Add user feedback for upload progress and success/failure states
8. [TODO] Expand Playwright tests to cover edge cases and error conditions
9. [TODO] Document all endpoint usage patterns and limitations
10. [TODO] Optimize file handling for large video files and memory usage
